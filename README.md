Simple Bitcoin flyers I used to onboard normies

This repository is to store some of my "onboarding" material I used with normies. Some simple flyers, to be printed on A4 horizontaly and fold them in 3 parts.

You are free to download and modify them as you wish.

Files are uploaded in final form "pdf" and also in InDesign format (indd) if you want to modify them. The pdfs are also not protected so you can edit them directly if you wish.

The flyers are already in various languages. You are welcome to contribute with any other language.
